Retail Sales Analysis with SQL and Python

This repository showcases a retail sales analysis project that combines SQL and Python to analyze and process large datasets. The project includes SQL queries for various sales-related insights and Python code for data preprocessing, loading, and further analysis.

Repository Contents:

	1.	SQL Code:
This file contains SQL queries used to extract insights such as top-selling products, sales trends, and region-wise performance from the retail dataset.
	•	File: sql_codes.sql
 
	2.	Python Code:
This Python script handles the data extraction, preprocessing, and loading of the dataset into a SQL database. It also includes the logic for cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and performing data transformation.
	•	File: orders_data_analysis.py

Key Features:

	•	SQL Analysis:
	•	Identified top 10 revenue-generating products.
	•	Analyzed month-over-month sales growth for 2022 and 2023.
	•	Determined region-wise top-selling products and the category with the highest sales growth.
	•	Python Data Processing:
	•	Downloaded and cleaned the dataset using Pandas.
	•	Calculated new metrics like profit and sales price.
	•	Uploaded processed data into a SQL database for further analysis.

Skills Demonstrated:

	•	SQL
	•	Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy)
	•	Data Preprocessing
	•	Data Analysis

Outcome:

	•	Provided actionable insights on product sales, growth trends, and regional performance.
	•	Automated data processing using Python for efficient data management.
	•	Improved decision-making for marketing and sales strategies through detailed analysis.

How to Use:

	1.	Download the SQL code file (sql_codes.sql) to execute the queries in your SQL environment.
	2.	Use the Python script (orders_data_analysis.py) to preprocess the raw dataset and load it into a SQL database for further analysis.
